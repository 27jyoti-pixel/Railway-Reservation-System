# Railway Reservation System
This project is a simple Railway Reservation System made using Linked List and Queue data structures in Python. It allows users to book tickets, cancel tickets, and manage waiting lists easily.  When seats are available, the passenger gets a confirmed seat (stored in a linked list). If all seats are full, the passenger is added to a waiting list (managed using a queue). When someone cancels a ticket, the first person from the waiting list automatically gets the seat.  It is a small DSA-based project made to understand how linked lists and queues can be used in real-life problems like railway booking.
